# UMD-Nutritional-Tracker

Built this project during **Career Launch 2024 - Break Through Tech**

This full-stack web scraping system focused on the University of Maryland Nutrition Website. The system extracts information about various foods that is offered at the dining halls that day, which is then utilized to monitor the user's dietary intake. It keeps tabs on essential nutritional aspects like carbohydrates, fats, protein, and calories. The primary objective is to aid University of Maryland students in managing their diet effectively to reach their fitness objectives. I led the development of both the user interface and the system's backend. In the backend development phase, I focused on refining my skills with the BeautifulSoup4 parsing library. Additionally, during the frontend development, I gained fundamental proficiency in HTML, JavaScript, and JSON.
